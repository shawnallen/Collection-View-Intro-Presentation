Collection Views - An Introduction
==================================

Originally, the materials here were part of a much larger collection of samples and Xcode code snippets.  For a 20 minute long presentation to a local developer meetup -- they were simplified, shortened, and a complimentary Keynote deck was made.

Installation 
============

Copy the Xcode code snippets into your ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets directory to invoke the 4 character commented shortcuts.
